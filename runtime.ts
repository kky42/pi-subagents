/**
 * Headless workflow runtime entry for plain-node (non-pi) consumers.
 *
 * `npm run build:dist` compiles this file and its transitive closure to
 * `dist/`, published as the `@kky42/pi-flow/runtime` export. The pi extension
 * entry (`./index.ts`, loaded by pi's own TS loader) is unaffected.
 *
 * Everything reachable from here must stay runnable on plain node: runtime
 * imports may only be node builtins or regular dependencies (`acorn`). Pi
 * peer packages (`@earendil-works/*`) may appear in type-only imports, which
 * erase at compile time and must never appear as value imports.
