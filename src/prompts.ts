The \`workflow\` tool runs a saved or ad-hoc trusted JavaScript script that orchestrates many subagents and synthesizes their results. Reach for it when the user asks for a workflow or fan-out, when a saved workflow matches the request, or when a task splits into many independent subagent runs.

Tool input:
- Use \`{ name: 'saved-workflow-name', args }\` for a saved workflow listed below.
- Use \`{ scriptPath, args }\` to run a persisted script file. Add \`resumeFromRunId\` to reuse cached agent results from a previous run's unchanged prefix.
- Use \`{ script, args }\` for ad-hoc orchestration. Inline runs in persisted sessions return \`scriptPath\` and \`runId\` for later editing/resume; in-memory runs may only return \`runId\`. Provide exactly one of \`name\`, \`scriptPath\`, or \`script\`.

Inline script contract:
- First statement: \`export const meta = { name: 'short_name', description: 'non-empty' }\` (a plain literal; \`phases\` optional).
- Globals: agent(prompt, opts), parallel(thunks), pipeline(items, ...stages), phase(title), log(message), args, cwd. Call agent() at least once and return a JSON-serializable value (use \`null\` if there is no synthesized result). Results are canonicalized to JSON; non-plain objects are rejected.
- Plain JavaScript only; no imports, no Date APIs, no Math.random(). Simple Date/Math.random aliases and destructuring are rejected too. Scripts are trusted code; the determinism check is cooperative lint, not a sandbox.
- parallel() takes thunks: \`await parallel(items.map(i => () => agent('...', { label: '...' })))\`. pipeline(items, ...stages) pipelines each item through stages while items run concurrently — prefer it for multi-stage work (no barrier between stages); use parallel() only when you need all results together.

Each agent() spawns a fresh one-shot subagent unless you pass \`session_key\` to create or continue a resumable child conversation. Set \`subagent_type\` to use a profile's backend, model, thinking, prompt, and pi-backend tool allowlist:
${formatAvailableAgents(profiles)}

agent() options: \`label\` (short unique id), \`phase\` (progress group), \`subagent_type\` (profile above), \`session_key\` (caller-chosen key for a resumable child conversation), and \`schema\` (a portable strict JSON Schema). Pass \`schema\` when the script must branch, route, filter, or aggregate on the result: the subagent is forced to return one validated object and agent() resolves to that object instead of free text. Every object schema must set \`additionalProperties: false\`, list every property in \`required\`, and represent optional values with nullable types. Define schemas as static object literals or top-level consts so preflight can reject invalid schemas before any subagent starts. Omit \`schema\` for prose findings you only synthesize. Example — classify, then dispatch:
\`\`\`
const r = await agent("Classify " + file, { label: "classify", schema: { type: "object", additionalProperties: false, required: ["kind"], properties: { kind: { type: "string", enum: ["entry", "lib", "test"] } } } });
if (r.kind === "entry") { /* ... */ }
\`\`\`

Subagents do not inherit parent context unless you continue them with \`session_key\` — brief fresh agent() prompts fully. Pi-backed subagents do not receive Agent/workflow; external CLI backends use their own tool surface. Subagent fan-out is bounded by the same global concurrency cap as the Agent tool; the workflow queues excess agents and drains them as slots free.${formatSavedWorkflows(savedWorkflows)}`;
}

export function buildCoordinatorPrompt(profiles: Map<string, SubagentProfile>): string {
  return `# Subagent Delegation

Available agents:
${formatAvailableAgents(profiles)}

Use Agent when a specialized agent matches the task, the work can run independently, or delegating would keep large search/read output out of the main context.

Guidelines:
- Do not use subagents excessively; direct lookup is better when the target file, symbol, or value is already known.
- If the user asks for parallel work, launch independent Agent calls in the same assistant response.
- Subagents start fresh and do not inherit parent messages, tool results, or reasoning unless you pass the same caller-chosen session_key to continue that child conversation. Brief fresh subagents with all needed context.
- Pi-backed subagents do not receive Agent; external CLI backends use their own tool surface. Coordinate follow-up delegation from the main conversation after each result returns.
- Use session_key only when continuation is desired; otherwise omit it for a one-shot child. The Agent final message is returned to you as the tool result. Relay what matters to the user.

Example usage:
- User asks "explore this repo": use Agent with subagent_type "general-purpose" and ask it to map the project purpose, key directories, important files, scripts, tests, and caveats without editing files.
- User asks for a second opinion on a risky change: use Agent with subagent_type "general-purpose" and give it enough context to review independently.

Root-level parallel delegation is bounded by the extension. If the running limit is reached, extra Agent calls queue and drain as slots free.`;
